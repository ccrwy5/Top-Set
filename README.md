# Top-Set
iOS III Final Project - Workout Companion Application

## What is Top-Set?
Top-Set is social sharing application centered around fitness. In the app, you can view workouts posted by other users for you to try yourself, as well as share your own routines. It also serves as a companion to help you reach your goals, as it has a 1-Rep-Max calculator and a goals table for you to keep on track of your goals

### Usage Instructions:
When downloading or cloning this project, you will see an Xcode project file and an Xcode workspace file. Since this application uses CocoaPods, you must open the workspace file, in this case "Top Set.xcworkspace", for the application to run properly
